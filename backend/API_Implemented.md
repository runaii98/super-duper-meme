## Testing Status

All endpoints have been tested using:

1. Basic API tests (`test_basic_endpoints.js`)
2. Comprehensive API tests (`tests/test_api_endpoints.js`)

The tests verify that the endpoints return the expected responses and handle errors appropriately.

## Credential Management

The system supports dynamic credential handling for multiple cloud providers:

- AWS credentials are loaded from `main_server/credentials/aws.json`
- GCP credentials are loaded from `main_server/credentials/gcp.json`

The system will work with limited functionality if credentials for one or more providers are missing or invalid.
